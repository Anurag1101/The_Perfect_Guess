## Introduction

The Perfect Guess game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess that number. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. Once the correct number is guessed, the player is given the option to play again.

## How to Play

1. Run the game script.
2. When prompted, enter your guess for the number.
3. Follow the prompts based on whether your guess is higher or lower than the generated number.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. After a correct guess, decide if you want to play again or exit the game.

## Game Logic

The main components of the game logic include:

- **Random Number Generation**: The game uses Python's `random` library to generate a number between 1 and 100.
- **Guessing Loop**: A loop continues until the player guesses the correct number or chooses to stop playing.
- **Feedback System**: After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - If the guess is too high, the player is prompted to guess lower.
  - If the guess is too low, the player is prompted to guess higher.
- **Replay Option**: After a successful guess, the player can choose to play again or exit.

**Features:**
Random number generation for varied gameplay.
User-friendly prompts and feedback.
Option to play multiple rounds.
Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.
